                            It is the dream of many students to take admission in IITs, NITs, IIITs to peruse his engineering and I also have the same dream. In 2020 get admission to Nit Jamshedpur when the whole world facing a pandemic.
My first semester started in November 2020, all college activities are going online from daily class to hang out talk.
I remember the first class taken by our immediate seniors in which we have to give our intro and our seniors told us
the rule and regulations of the college. I don't want to go into detail but at that time I feel now I am also part of this college. Then our regular class started we all take full advantage of online classes like we attend the class lying on the bed, eating breakfast, or just join the class and do other things. Have you ever think about this, that one day you will attend your class lying on the bed, this is possible due to covid. Then our mid sem came, first college exam we all give our exam honestly. After mid sem, I 
start taking the classes seriously.
In march 2021 end sem came and again we honestly give our exam. After end sem I go to my cousin brother home and I with my cousin brothers
visit the Mountain of Barabar. We all enjoy the whole day in the mountains. Then our next semester started. In the second sem all societies of college give their introduction and giving us opportunity be part of that society. 
I was also selected in some of the interviews and finally selected in the NSS team. Along with team selection and regular classes our second semester
ended in July 2020. After end sem Voice(college society) has organized a three-day camp. I and some of my friends visit the camp. I enjoy the camp and spend a good time with seniors and some alumni.
We also visit our college campus that was an amazing experience. Due to this pandemic, I and many college students miss a lot but we have no other option. In August 2021 our third sem started with the same story and continuing...
